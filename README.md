# CORE-MODULE-2.
You have been recruited as a football analyst in a company - Mchezopesa Ltd and tasked to accomplish the task below.

A prediction result of a game between team 1 and team 2, based on who's home and who's away, and on whether or not the game is friendly (include rank in your training).

You have two possible approaches (as shown below) given the datasets that will be provided

Input: Home team, Away team, Tournament type (World cup, Friendly, Other)

Approach 1: Polynomial approach What to train given: Rank of home team Rank of away team Tournament type Model 1: Predict how many goals the home team scores.

Model 2: Predict how many goals the away team scores.

Approach 2: Logistic approach

Feature Engineering: Figure out from the home team’s perspective if the game is a Win, Lose or Draw (W, L, D)

Hint:

Rank Country Abbreviation Total Points Previous Points Rank Change Average Previous Years Points Average Previous Years Points Weighted (50%) Average 2 Years Ago Points Average 2 Years Ago Points Weighted (30%) Average 3 Years Ago Points Average 3 Years Ago Points Weighted (20%) Confederation Date - date of the match Home_team - the name of the home team Away_team - the name of the away team Home_score - full-time home team score including extra time, not including penalty-shootouts Away_score - full-time away team score including extra time, not including penalty-shootouts Tournament - the name of the tournament City - the name of the city/town/administrative unit where the match was played Country - the name of the country where the match was played Neutral - TRUE/FALSE column indicating whether the match was played at a neutral venue Assessment Expectation

In order to work on the above problem, you need to do the following:

Define the question, the metric for success, the context, experimental design taken and the appropriateness of the available data to answer the given question Expected flow for the assessment: Perform your EDA Perform any necessary feature engineering Check of multicollinearity Start building the model Cross-validate the model Compute RMSE Create residual plots for your models, and assess their heteroscedasticity using Bartlett’s test Perform appropriate regressions on the data including your justification Challenge your solution by providing insights on how you can make improvements.
