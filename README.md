## As a football analyst in a company - Mchezopesa Ltd predict the result of a game between team 1 and team 2

* You have been recruited as a football analyst in a company - Mchezopesa Ltd and tasked to accomplish the task below. A prediction result of a game between team 1 and team 2, based on who's home and who's away, and on whether or not the game is friendly (include rank in your training).

* You have two possible approaches (as shown below) given the datasets that will be provided
Input: Home team, Away team, Tournament type (World cup, Friendly, Other)

## Approach 1: Polynomial approach What to train given: Rank of home team Rank of away team Tournament type 
* Model 1: Predict how many goals the home team scores.
* Model 2: Predict how many goals the away team scores.

## Approach 2: Logistic approach
Feature Engineering: Figure out from the home team’s perspective if the game is a Win, Lose or Draw (W, L, D)
### Hint:
Home Team, Home Team Score, Away Team, Away Team Score, Year, Home Team Rank, Away Team Rank, Tournament Type, Status (W,L,D) Morocco 2 Kenya 1 2003 20 58 World Cup Win

* Context A more detailed explanation and history of the rankings is available here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Rankings]

### In order to work on the above problem, you need to do the following:
* Define the question
* the metric for success
* the context
* experimental design taken
* the appropriateness of the available data to answer the given question Expected flow for the assessment: 
* Perform your EDA 
* Perform any necessary feature engineering Check of multicollinearity Start building the model Cross-validate the model Compute RMSE Create residual plots for your models, and assess their heteroscedasticity using Bartlett’s test Perform appropriate regressions on the data including your justification Challenge your solution by providing insights on how you can make improvements.
